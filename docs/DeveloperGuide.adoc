By: `Team W14-3`      Since: `Sept 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedpatient.java[`XmlAdaptedpatient.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork (separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`)) | you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your patiental fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor (second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#) | UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method(s) where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `patientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `MedicationView`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `patient` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `patient` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
 image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::addappt[]
=== Addappt
==== Current implementation
The `addappt` command provides functionality for users to add an appointment for a given patient.
This is done by adding appointment-related information to a given person, represented by a `Person` object.
This allows for users to track the upcoming appointments for every patient.

The adding of appointment-related information is facilitated by the following classes:

* `AppointmentsList`, a list of
** `Appointment`, each of which have a
*** `Type`

A more detailed description of the classes follows below:

* `AppointmentsList`
** Every `Person` has an `AppointmentsList`, the purpose of which is to store all `Appointment` belonging to a `Person`.
** A wrapper class around the internal representation of a list of appointments that exposes only a few select methods in the `List` API.
*** The methods relevant to the `addappt` command from the API are: `add`.
* `Appointment`
** Class encapsulating all the information about a particular appointment.
*** These information include the type of appointment (enum Type), name of the procedure, date and time of the appointment and the name of the doctor-in-charge of the appointment
* `Type`
** An enumeration that covers all the different types of medical procedures. The four types are:
*** `PROPAEDEUTIC`, with `PROP` as abbreviation
*** `DIAGNOSTIC`, with `DIAG` as abbreviation
*** `THERAPEUTIC`, with `THP` as abbreviation
*** `SURGICAL`, with `SRG` as abbreviation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the relevant classes behave at each step.
At the end of the explanation is a link:{repoURL}/src/main/docs/images/AddApptSequenceDiagram.png[sequence diagram] of a typical addappt command execution.

The user executes `addappt ic/S1234567A type/SRG pn/Heart Bypass dt/27-04-2019 1030 doc/Dr. Pepper`.
This command has the following intent: Record the following appointment to a patient with NRIC = S1234567A:

[cols="1,2a,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Appt. type |Procedure name |Date and time |Doctor-in-charge

|`SRG`
|Heart Bypass
|27-04-2019 1030
|Dr. Pepper
|===

The command is passed to an instance of the `LogicManager` class, which in turn executes `AddressBookParser::parse`.
The `AddressBookParser` parses the command word (`addappt`) and executes `AddApptCommandParser::parse`.

The `AddApptCommandParser::parse` method returns an `AddApptCommand` object which encapsulates the necessary information to update the Person 's appointments(s).
Control then passes back to the `LogicManager`, which calls `AddApptCommand::execute`.

[NOTE]
If no/multiple patient(s) with that `NRIC` exist(s), then the `AddApptCommand::execute` method will throw a `CommandException` with the appropriate error message and the usage case will end.

The `AddApptCommand::execute` method constructs a new `Person` object using all the details of the old `Person`, with the sole difference being the `AppointmentsList` used being a deep copy of the original `Person`'s `AppointmentsList` with the new `Appointment` added.
This updated `Person` object is used to update the existing `Person` object using the `Model::updatePerson` method (or an overridden version) of the backing model.
Finally, the `AddApptCommand::execute` method terminates, returning a `CommandResult` with a success message. The `LogicManager` then returns the same `CommandResult` as the return value of the `LogicManager::execute` method.
The command execution then ends.

[#img-addapptsequencediagram]
The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the `addappt` command:

.Execution sequence of the `addappt` command
image::AddapptSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Representation of types of medical procedures
* **Alternative 1 (Current implementation):** Use an `Enum` for `Type`
** Pros: Makes for easier handling of incorrect values.
** Cons: Requires more effort to filter and retrieve the different types.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a switch case to handle the different types
** Pros: Makes the process easier to handle.
** Cons: Makes the code more difficult to read.

// end::addappt[]
// tag::adddiet[]
=== Adddiet

==== Current implementation

The `adddiet` command provides functionality for users to add dietary requirements for a given patient. +
This command allows users to add three different types of dietary requirements: allergy, cultural requirement and physical difficulty. +
This command adds these dietary requirements to a given `Person` , so that the dietary requirements can be viewed later on.

===== Classes involved

The adding of the dietary requirements involve the following classes:

* `DietCollection`, which is a set of
** `Diet`, which consists of the detail of the requirement and its type
*** `DietType`.

A more detailed description of the classes involved is as follows:

* `Diet Collection`
** Every `Person` object has a `Diet Collection`, which is a collection of all the dietary requirements of the given patient.
** This class is a wrapper class around the internal representation of a `Set` of `Diet` s.

* `Diet`
** This class encapsulate the information of a single dietary requirement.
** Specifically, an instance of this class is composed of
*** a `String` representing the details of the requirement in text, and
*** a `DietType` representing the type of this dietary requirement (allergy, cultural requirement, or physical difficulty).

* `DietType`
** This is a `Enum` class representing the three different types of dietary requirements.
** Implemented as `Enum` class to avoid typo and invalid types being entered.

===== Execution of the command

Given below is an usage scenario and the details when executing `adddiet` command. +
For example, when the user executes `adddiet ic/S1234567A alg/Egg alg/Crab cr/Halal pd/Hands cannot move.`:

* The command text is passed to an instance of the `Logic Manager` class.
* The `Logic Manager` instance calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`, which parses the `adddiet` command word.
* Next, the `AddDietCommandParser#parse` method parses the different dietary requirements into one `DietCollection` object. An instance of `AddDietCommand` is returned after the parsing.
* `Logic Manager` then execute this `AddDietCommand` by calling `AddDietCommand#execute`.
* In the `AddDietCommand#execute` method, the new `DietCollection` object is added to a new copy of the `Person` object.
* The new `Person` object is updated to the model by `Model#updatePerson` method.
* A new `CommandResult` is returned and the execution ends.

[#img-adddietsequencediagram]
Here is the sequence diagram of the typical execution of an `adddiet` command:

.Execution sequence of the `adddiet` command
image::AdddietSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to represent different kinds of dietary requirements

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Use a `Enum` inside the `Diet class` and contain all `Diet` in one collection.
** Pros: Results in less repetitive code and cleaner design.
** Cons: Requires more effort to filter or retrieve different types of `Diet` from one `DietCollection`.

* **Alternative 2:** Use polymorphism to extends `Diet` class and add three different collections to a `Person`.
** Pros: Makes it easier to retrieve different types of dietary requirements.
** Cons: Results in a lot of repetitive code since the three different types do not differ much.

===== Aspect: Data structure to hold the different `Diet` objects

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Use `HashSet` and override the `hashCode` for `Diet`.
** Pros: Makes it easier to handle duplication in adding dietary requirement.
** Cons: Causes the order in which dietary requirements are added to be lost. (However, the sequence is not important for the current set of features implemented.)

* **Alternative 2:** Use `ArrayList`.
** Pros: Preserves the order in which dietary requirements are added.
** Cons: Makes it harder to handle duplicates.

// end::adddiet[]
// tag::addmeds[]
=== Addmeds
==== Current implementation

The `addmeds` command provides functionality for users to add prescription-related information for a given patient.
This is done by adding prescription-related information to a given person, represented by a `Person` object.
This allows for a patient to build up a history of prescriptions for viewing at a later date.

The adding of prescription-related information is facilitated by the following classes:

* `PrescriptionList`, a list of
** `Prescription` s, each of which have a
*** `Dose` and a
*** `Duration`.

A more detailed description of the classes follows below:

* `PrescriptionList`
** Every `Person` has a `PrescriptionList`, the purpose of which is to store the `Person` 's `Prescriptions`.
** A wrapper class around the internal representation of a list of prescriptions that exposes only a few select methods in its API.
*** The methods relevant for the `addmeds` command execution are: `add`
* `Prescription`
** Class encapsulating all the information about a given medication prescription.
*** More specifically, the `Prescription` class encapsulates the name of the drug prescribed, the dosage information (itself stored as a `Dose` object), and the duration of the prescription (as a `Duration` object).
* `Dose`
** Class encapsulating all the information about a given medication dosage.
*** More specifically, the `Dose` class encapsulates the dose, dosage unit, and doses per day to administer.
* `Duration`
** Class encapsulating all the information about a given time period.
*** More specifically, the `Duration` class encapsulates the duration of the time period in milliseconds, and the calendar dates for the start and end of that time period.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the relevant classes behave at each step. +
At the end of the explanation is a <<img-addmedssequencediagram, sequence diagram>> of a typical `addmeds` command execution.

The user executes `addmeds ic/S1234567A d/Paracetamol q/2 u/tablets n/4 t/14` . +
This command has the following intent: Prescribe the following medication to a patient with NRIC = S1234567A: +

|=======================================================================
| Drug Name | Dosage | Duration
| Paracetamol | 2 tablets, 4 times a day | 14 days, from current date to 14 days from now.
|=======================================================================


The command text is passed to an instance of the `LogicManager` class, which in turn executes `AddressBookParser::parse`. +
The `AddressBookParser` parses the command word (`addmeds`) and executes `AddmedsCommandParser::parse`. +
This causes the `AddmedsCommandParser` to construct the following objects in the following order: +

|===
| Index | Information used | Class instances used | Class instance constructed
| 1 | Dosage, Dosage unit, Doses per day | nil | `Dose` object
| 2 | Duration in days | nil | `Duration` object
| 3 | NRIC | nil | `Nric` object
| 4 | Drug name | `Dose`, `Duration` | `Prescription` object
| 5 | nil | `Nric`, `Prescription` | `AddmedsCommand` object
|===

The `AddmedsCommandParser::parse` method returns an `AddmedsCommand` object which encapsulates the necessary information to update the `Person` 's medication(s). +
Control then passes back to the `LogicManager`, which calls `AddmedsCommand::execute`. +

****
NOTE: If no/multiple patient(s) with that NRIC exist, then the `AddmedsCommand::execute` method will throw a `CommandException` with the appropriate error message and the usage case will end.
****

The `AddmedsCommand::execute` method constructs a new `Person` object using all the details of the old Person, with the sole difference being the `PrescriptionList` used being a deep copy of the original `Person` 's `PrescriptionList` with the new `Prescription` added.
This updated `Person` object is used to update the existing `Person` object using the `Model::updatePerson` method (or an overridden version) of the backing model.
Finally, the `AddmedsCommand::execute` method terminates, returning a `CommandResult` with a success message.
The `LogicManager` then returns the same `CommandResult` as the return value of the `LogicManager::execute` method.
The command execution then ends.

[#img-addmedssequencediagram]
The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the `addmeds` command:

.Execution sequence of the `addmeds` command
image::AddmedsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the medication data storage
* **Alternative 1 (Current implementation):** Store the data inside multiple POJO classes, with new classes being introduced as necessary to maintain high cohesion of individual classes. For example, the `Duration` class holds temporal information, whereas the `Dose` class holds medication dosage-related information.
** Pros: Maintains the Single Responsibility Principle (e.g. the `Prescription` class now changes only if there are changes to the structure of a physical prescription, and not due to (e.g.) changes in time representation, or the way that dosage-related information is stored.
** Cons: Increases the number of classes we will have to maintain.
* **Alternative 2:** Store all the data directly as members inside a single `Prescription` class.
** Pros: Reduces the number of classes we will have to maintain.
** Cons: Reduces the cohesion of the `Prescription` class as it now handles multiple different items e.g. dosage-related information and duration-related information.

// end::addmeds[]
// tag::addmh[]
=== Addmh
==== Current implementation

The functionalities of the `addmh` command are interlinked: the former allows the user to record a diagnosis
into a patient’s medical history, while the latter permits the viewing of a patient’s past diagnoses as recorded in
medical history.

Each patient’s information is stored within the `Person` objects. The execution of the `addmh` command results in the retrieval of
a particular `Person` object, and the consequent updating of the patient’s `MedicalHistory`.


Stated below is an example usage scenario and an explanation of the interactions that occurs as a result of the code execution.

The user executes the following commands:

* `addmh ic/S9123124A mh/Hypertension, diagnosed “years ago”, well contracted with Metoponol`

*Intent*

The purpose of the keyed `addmh` command line is to register and record a diagnosis under the registered patient with
the `NRIC` S9123124A.

==== Command execution

The sequence diagram below shows the execution of the given scenario:

.Execution sequence of the `addmh` command
image::AddmhSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* `addmh ic/S9123124A mh/Hypertension, diagnosed “years ago”, well contracted with Metoponol`
** When the user-executed `addmh` line is passed into an instance of the LogicManager class, the method `AddressBookParser::parse` is executed.
`AddressBookParser` then parses the command word `addmh` and subsequently executes `AddmhCommandParser::parse`.

** Next, arguments prefixed by `ic/` and `mh/` are parsed into `NRIC` and `Diagnosis` objects to be used in the `AddmhCommand` constructor.

** The instantiated `AddmhCommand` will be the medium through which the `Person` with the `NRIC` S9123124A is updated.

*** In the `AddmhCommand#execute` method, a new `MedicalHistory` object is added to a new copy of the `Person` object.
*** The new `Person` object is updated by the model by the `Model::updatePerson` method.
*** A new `CommandResult` object is returned.

* Command execution ends.

****
NOTE: If multiple patients with the entered `NRIC` exist, then the `AddmhCommand::execute` will throw a `CommandException`
with an appropriate error message before the use case ends.
****

==== Design Considerations

// end::addmh[]

=== Visitorin/Viewvisitors/Visitorout

==== Current implementation
There three commands related to manage patients' visitors. +

The `visitorin` command allows user to add visitors into patient's visitorList. Every patient will has his/her own `VisitorList` and
the maximum number of visitors for a patient is set to be 5 in order to provide patient's a comfortable resting environment. +

The `viewvisitors` command allows user to view a patient's current visitors in his/her `VisitorList`. It displays all the visitors from the requested patient's
`visitorList` in order of entry. +

The `visitorout` command allows user to remove a visitor from patient's `VisitorList`.

===== Classes associated
The three commands are executed mainly depends on the classes of `VisitorList` and `Visitor`. Each `Person` object contains a
`VisitorList`. The `visitorin` and `visitorout` commands are created to add/remove a `Visitor` in the required `Person` 's `VisitorList`.
The `viewvisitors` command display the `Person` 's `VisitorList`.

* `VisitorList`, a list of
** `Visitor` s

A more detailed description of the classes involved is as follows:

* `Visitor`
** This class encapsulates the given name of the visitor.
** `String` represent the visitor name.

* `VisitorList`
** Using `List` type of structure to store all the `Visitor` s stored for a particular patient

==== Commands Execution
To illustrate how the three commands work, examples are given below.

* `visitorin ic/S1234567A v/Jane`
** The command inputs are passed to an instance of the `LogicManager` class.
** `AddressBookParser` parses the command word (`visitorin`) and executes `VisitorInCommandParser::parse`.
** `VisitorInCommandParser::parse` construct and a `Visitor` (Jane), `Nric` (S1234567A) of the patient provided by the user and then returns `VisitorinCommand` object.
** In `VisitorinCommand`, new `Visitor` object is created and added to a copy of the required `Person` object's `VisitorList`
*** The new `Person` object is updated to the model by `Model#updatePerson` method.
*** A new CommandResult object is returned and the execution ends.


* `viewvisitor ic/S1234567A`
** Similar to the `visitorin` command, `ViewvisitorsCommandParser::parse` the required patient's ic(S1234567A) and returns a `ViewvisitorsCommand` object
** `ViewvisitorsCommand` retrieves the person with the required patient's ic and construct a copy of selected patient's VisitorList for display
*** A new CommandResult object is returned and the execution ends.


* `visitorout ic/S1234567A v/Jane`
** Similar to the `visitorin` command, `VisitoroutCommandParser::parse` construct and a `Visitor` (Jane), `Nric` (S1234567A) of the patient provided by the user and then returns `VisitoroutCommand` object.
** In `VisitoroutCommand`, new `Visitor` object is created and removed from the copy of the required `Person` object's `VisitorList`
*** The new `Person` object is updated to the model by `Model#updatePerson` method.

=== Logging

We are using the `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently, log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g app name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use AsciiDoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose AsciiDoc over Markdown because AsciiDoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the third one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, HealthBase depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

=== Generating test data
. Generating patients with mock data

.. Open the application.
.. Run the following commands in the following sequence:
... `dev-mode` (Enables developer mode; the next command requires developer mode to run.)
... `gendata NUMBER_OF_PATIENTS`, where `NUMBER_OF_PATIENTS` is a positive integer value that indicates how many patients you wish to generate.

The application will then generate that number of patients with mock data for their:

. Personal particulars
.. NRIC
.. Name
.. Phone number
.. Email address
.. Physical address
. Drug allergies
. Medications
. Appointments
. Dietary restrictions
. Medical history

Details on the exact range of values that the mock data can take on can be found in the related `.java` files.

// end::gendata[]

=== Deleting a patient

. Deleting a patient while all patients are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all patients using the `list` command. Multiple patients in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No patient is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
